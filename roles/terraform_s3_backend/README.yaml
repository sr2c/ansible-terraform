description: |-
  Ansible role to deploy the resources to use S3 for remote Terraform state storage. A DynamoDB table is created to
  enable state locking.
  
  ![Architecture diagram](./docs/terraform_s3_backend.png)

  **WARNING:** There is an assumption in this module that you'll be deploying the state backend to an AWS account that
  you're then also going to deploy infrastructure to and you're likely logged in with an administrator account.
  No permissions or IAM roles are configured for accessing the state bucket other than via administrator access. If
  you are consolidating your Terraform state across projects into a single AWS account then you'd probably want to
  use per-project IAM roles for accessing and modifying state.
introduction: |-
  ### Requirements
  
  You will need to have installed:
  
  * [AWS CLI v2](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
  * [boto3](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/)
usage: |-
  The following example shows how to ensure that the backend has been created, and then use the registered backend
  configuration with the terraform_module role. Note the use of the combine filter to add the key to the configuration
  to ensure that each module uses its own state object in the S3 bucket.
  
  ```yaml
  ---
  hosts: all
  roles:
    - role: sr2c.terraform.terraform_s3_backend
      vars:
        terraform_state_s3_bucket_name: "my-example-terraform-state"
      delegate_to: localhost
    - role: sr2c.terraform.terraform_module
      vars:
        terraform_module_backend_config:
          s3: "{{ terraform_s3_backend_config | combine({'key': 'example'}) }}"
        terraform_module_source: "sr2c/tor-bridge/aws"
        terraform_module_version: "0.1.0"
        terraform_module_inputs:
          name: "my-example-bridge"
      delegate_to: localhost
  ```
  
  To use the created backend directly in Terraform using a Jinja2 template, add a backend configuration block to the
  template file:
  
  ```hcl
  terraform {
    backend "s3" {
      bucket         = "{{ terraform_s3_backend_config['bucket'] }}"
      dynamodb_table = "{{ terraform_s3_backend_config['dynamodb_table'] }}"
      key            = "example"
      region         = "{{ terraform_s3_backend_config['region'] }}"
    }
  }
  ```
