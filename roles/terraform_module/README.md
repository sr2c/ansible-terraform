This role provides the complete steps necessary to deploy cloud resources using Terraform from a given Terraform
module. The module may be available in the local filesystem, via the Terraform registry, or any of the other
[supported module sources](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/sources). For modules source
types that support specifying a version, that can also be achieved using this module.

The workflow in this modules tasks are illustrated in the following flowchart:

## Usage



The following example creates the necessary resources in AWS to enable the use of an S3 backend (including a
DynamoDB table to facilitate state locking) and then creates a Tor bridge using the
[sr2c/tor-bridge/aws](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/sr2c/tor-bridge/aws/latest) Terraform module. It assumes
that the necessary environment variables to allow AWS authentication have been set where the playbook is to be
executed.

```yaml
---
hosts: all
roles:
  - role: sr2c.terraform.terraform_s3_backend
    vars:
      terraform_state_s3_bucket_name: "my-example-terraform-state"
    delegate_to: localhost
  - role: sr2c.terraform.terraform_module
    vars:
      terraform_module_backend_config:
        s3: "{{ terraform_s3_backend_config | combine({'key': 'aws_base'}) }}"
      terraform_module_source: "sr2c/tor-bridge/aws"
      terraform_module_version: "0.1.0"
      terraform_module_inputs:
        name: "my-example-bridge"
      terraform_module_outputs_var: "terraform_outputs_example"
    delegate_to: localhost
tasks:
  - name: Print out the hashed fingerprint of the deployed bridge
    ansible.builtin.debug:
      var: terraform_outputs_example.hashed_fingerprint
```

## Trans Rights

![Trans Rights Are Human Rights][trans_rights]

Trans is an umbrella term to describe people whose gender is not the same as, or does not sit comfortably with, the
sex they were assigned at birth. *Like all people*, they have the right to be treated with dignity and respect and to
have their human rights protected.

Transgender people face significant discrimination and prejudice in many areas of their lives, including employment,
education, housing, and healthcare. They are also at increased risk of violence and hate crimes. These issues
can have a serious impact on the physical and mental well-being of transgender people and can prevent them from fully
participating in society.

Transgender rights are therefore an important part of the broader struggle for human rights. Everyone, regardless of
their gender identity, should be able to live their lives free from discrimination and to enjoy the same rights and
opportunities as everyone else. This includes the right to express their gender identity and to be treated with respect
and dignity.

It is important for society to recognize and respect the rights of transgender people, and to take steps to address the
discrimination and prejudice that they face. This can include supporting policies and laws that protect transgender
people from discrimination and promoting acceptance and understanding of transgender people within the broader
community.

* [Gendered Intelligence](https://genderedintelligence.co.uk/) is a trans-led and trans-involving grassroots organisation
  with a wealth of lived experience, community connections of many kinds, and a depth and breadth of trans community
  knowledge. They offer staff training, consultancy, youth work, mentoring and undertake public engagement activities.

* [TransAid Cymru](https://transaid.cymru/) began life as a local mutual aid group in Cardiff. Tired of the ways that the
  electoral political system had let the trans community down, they decided it was time to do something for themselves.
  Many of the founding members were disabled and unemployed. Familiar with the real, material needs of the trans
  community and how little support there was out there, they founded the mutual aid group in order to provide the services
  the trans community needed.
